        What is Camp at Young Life?:
    </p>
    <p class="reason1">
        Camp at Young Life is a trip of a lifetime. Hundreds of thousands of kids around the world join us on our camp for 

a week or even just a weekend, regardless of the time they spend with us, it is going to be a time that they will 

never forget. Here at camp, it involves a lot of adventure, fun, great food, and excellent speakers to tell a 

message of God's love in terms they can understand. Us at Young Life usually camp in resort-quality facilities were  

kids will get the chance to escape from their stress or their everyday pressures and just learn to relax with the  

community here at Young Life and have a wonderful time. We also encourage kids to join us that are often overlooked from 

being in economically depressed communities, kids with disabilities, and teenage mothers. Overall, we are thrilled 

to have kids around the world to join us and well make sure that it will be a time of their life.

    <p>
        Here at camp, we came in being shy and we did not want to associate with people at all but over the course of time we have  

learned to associate with new people and get to know them better and make new friends. We had a blast at camp 

from fun adventured to learning God's words. So yes, we would recommend anyone looking forward to having a blast 

of their lifetime to come down to camp here at Young Life.
